## Grasp CSS

Reactjs imports a bare-bone SCSS file called Grasp CSS. Some of the most used CSS properties are defined in terms of variables so that your wokflow can minimize the usage of abstract values. However, Grasp CSS does not tie you up with only these variables. Feel free to update the variables as per your requirements.

## Download
